# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
  * I think I have a fairly good understanding of how this method works now. The only iterating i've done up until now is using for loops and this is SO much simpler, I love it.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  * I actually really enjoyed looking up all the various methods that exist (and trying things out first to see if it would work). For example, I thought maybe you could get the first character of a string by using the first method (thinking strings are arrays) but that didn't work! Quick google taught be about the chr method.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * I'm really curious about how you iterate with more control.. say I didn't want to iterate over Every element in an array and only wanted to look at certain ones. Or up until a certain value or something? I dunno.. I think there's a lot of finesse that's probably possible that i'm super interested in learning about. I think i'll just focus on the lessons we're covering now for the moment as there's plenty of new stuff to wrap my head around.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * The ruby docs! Such a great resource. I'm also loving just playing around in irb and/or atom and trying stuff out. As always, my classmates are super valuable as well if I have any questions.
